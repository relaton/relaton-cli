 RFC XML v3 Example: A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on
                             Avian Carriers

Abstract

   Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low
   altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single
   point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,
   but many carriers can be used without significant interference with
   each other, outside of early spring.  This is because of the 3D ether
   space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used by
   IEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance
   system, which increases availability.  Unlike some network
   technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to
   line-of-sight distance.  Connection oriented service is available in
   some cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.

Note

   Yes, this is an April Fool's RFC.

1.  Frame Format

   The IP _datagram_ is *printed*, on a small scroll of paper, in
   hexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.
   The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.
   A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  The
   bandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, and
   paradoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  A
   typical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be
   needed.alt [RFC7253]

   Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of the
   datagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittable
   form.[RFC7253]

   This document extends OpenPGP and its ECC extension to support SM2,
   SM3 and SM4:

   *  support the SM3 hash algorithm for data validation purposes

   *  support signatures utilizing the combination of SM3 with other
      digital signing algorithms, such as RSA, ECDSA and SM2

   *  support the SM2 asymmetric encryption algorithm for public key
      operations

   *  support usage of SM2 in combination with supported hash
      algorithms, such as SHA-256 and SM3

   *  support the SM4 symmetric encryption algorithm for data protection
      purposes

   *  defines the OpenPGP profile "OSCCA-SM234" to enable usage of
      OpenPGP in an OSCCA-compliant manner.

   Algorithm-Specific Fields for SM2DSA keys:

   *  a variable-length field containing a curve OID, formatted as
      follows:

      a.  a one-octet size of the following field; values 0 and 0xFF are
          reserved for future extensions

      b.  octets representing a curve OID.

   *  MPI of an EC point representing a public key

2.  Supported Algorithms

2.1.  Public Key Algorithms

   The SM2 algorithm is supported with the following extension.

      |  NOTE: ECDH is defined in Section 8 of this document.

   The following public key algorithm IDs are added to expand
   Section 9.1 of RFC4880, "Public-Key Algorithms":

                    +-----+--------------------------+
                    | ID  | Description of Algorithm |

3.  Security Considerations

   Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but special
   measures MUST be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriers
   are used in a tactical environment.[RFC7253], [ISO.IEC.10118-3]
